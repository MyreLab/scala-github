# The GitHub History of the Scala Language

My submission to a DataCamp project where I cleaned up and visualised key insights from [Scala's](https://github.com/scala) project repository. The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files. I prepared and merged information on almost 30k commits from 2011 to 2018 to visualise which developers were most involved in the project and how the number of contributions changed over time.
